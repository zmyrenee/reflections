How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    type FC followed by the two file name in the command line in windows

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can easily access to the previous version of the code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I can save at the point I want and back to that point easily. As for Google
    docs, I need to know the where I want to back and find the point.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The target user is different. Git target more towards coders, while Google
    docs target most on normal people. Coder may need multiple files saved
    together while most people only need to save one file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    type git log to find the identification code of the commit that I want,
    then type git diff and the identification code to compare the two commits.
    Warning, the closer to the top, the latest the commit is.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I am not sure at this point. It seems annoying....

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Yes! I would like to practice until I got familiar with Git!
