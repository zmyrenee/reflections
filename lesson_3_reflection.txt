When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I would like to share my work with others or I would like to work together with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If so, I could make sure the commits that I push are everything that I would like to share.
